# Tutorials and Workshops
Repo for the material used during conference tutorial and talks

## Applied Machine Learning Days 2020

At the end of the workshop, the participants will acquire practical skills related to the analysis of real-world mobility data. In particular, they will be able to use **scikit-mobility** to filter and clean mobility data, compute standard mobility metrics, generate their own synthetic mobility data, and assess the privacy risk of each user described in the analyzed mobility data set.
